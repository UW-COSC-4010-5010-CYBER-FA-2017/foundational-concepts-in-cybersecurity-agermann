My example of least privilege is a driver utility program. If the user runs it as a system admin, they are able to update their drivers. If they run it as a normal user, they have insufficient privileges to update their drivers.

My non-example of least privilege is quite similar to my working example. In this one, however, the user is able to change important files no matter their access level. 

The picture I uploaded is an example of using system privilege levels to gate users. The user is granted the least possible privilege based on their credentials.
