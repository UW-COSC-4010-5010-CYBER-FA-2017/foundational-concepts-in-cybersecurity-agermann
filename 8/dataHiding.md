In my data hiding example, the user is able to buy tickets from a lottery machine. At no point in the program is the winning lottery number or cost of ticket able to be changed.

On the contrary, in my non-example, I left the cost and winning lottery number wide open. Any malicious hacker could easily access and/or change those variables quite easily. 

My picture shows a method of hiding data in a file system. Only the user's music and allowed files are able to be accessed, while the other files are locked.
