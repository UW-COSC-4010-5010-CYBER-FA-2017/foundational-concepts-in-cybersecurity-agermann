My example of Domain Separation shows what happens when production and test data is separated. Developers are free to test on the test data as much as they want without affecting production.

My non-example uses production data as a playground for developers to test on. This is highly incorrect as devs should not be messing with production data for testing.

The picture included shows a typical separation of test and prod environments, utilizing domain separation.
