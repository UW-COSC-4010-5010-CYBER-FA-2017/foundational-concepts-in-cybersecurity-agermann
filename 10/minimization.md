My example of minimization involved the principle of least privilege. In the example, I had the user grant admin rights to install a piece of software. Immediately after installing the software, the admin rights are revoked. This emphasizes that the user should only have access to admin rights for specific tasks (following the principle of least privilege).

My non-example was similar, but it did not revoke access to the admin rights. This would allow the software (or malicious attackers) another vulnerability to attack the system through.

My picture was of a drawbridge and gate in a castle. Much like the castle walls, you must restrict access to potential vulnerabilities through a small window (like the drawbridge).
