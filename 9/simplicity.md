My example of simplicity is as simple as it gets - it takes in two inputs, adds them together, and displays the result. Easy to use, easy to understand.

My non-example of simplicity performs the same function. However, it asks you pointless trivia questions that you need the Internet or a user manual to know. It also for some reason restricts the software to Laosian citizens (or people who know Laos's capital). The password and trivia question are completely unnecessary for a possibly simple program such as an addition calculator.

My picture of simplicity shows that programs shouldn't be a maze, but a straight, simple line through a possible maze. :)
