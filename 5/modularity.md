In my modularity example, I made the world's faultiest multiplication machine. The machine has a problem where its flux capacitator fails roughly half the time. Despite the module of the multiplication machine failing, the software continues to run.

In my non-example, I made a similar multiplication machine. However, the machine is not modular. This means that when the machine fails, it causes the whole program to crash and burn.

My picture is of a bunch of Legos. Legos are the ultimate modular piece as they all fit together and work on their own without crashing the whole system.
