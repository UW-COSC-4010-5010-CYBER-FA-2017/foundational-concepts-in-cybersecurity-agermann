My example of process isolation shows the processes for Word, Paint, and Pinball trying to access address spaces. All of these processes have separate address spaces to ensure correct operation and security.

My non-examples is very similar to my example. The difference is that the processes are all accessing a shared address space, leading to security concerns.

My picture shows an example of how memory may be allocated to use process isolation.
