My example of layering is one similar to the example in the powerpoint. The application accesses the operating system which accesses the kernel which accesses the HAL (I stopped there, my point was proven). The application is never able to directly access the HAL or anything similar.

In my non-example, the application may access any of the other layers directly. There is no concept of layering included, only a bunch of separate entities to be accessed.

My picture is an example of layering security to protect sensitive data.
