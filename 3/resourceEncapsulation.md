My example illustrates resource encapsulation using the flagpole example. You are able to put the flag on the pole, take if off the pole, raise the flag, and lower the flag. You are not able to use the resource (the flag) to do anything else.

My non-example also uses the flag analogy. In this non-example, you are able to do anything you want to the flag - nothing is off-limits.

My picture shows a way to encapsulate the resource of a DVD player. The user is given the option to play, pause, fast forward, etc. They are not given the option of, say, snapping the disc in half or setting it on fire.
